I was a good kid. I went to school, did my homework, and didn’t fuss when it was bedtime. I took AP classes, went to after school activities, and got into a great college. I did what I was supposed to do.  

And in my final semester at college, I applied to a variety of jobs for which my economics degree would suffice and secured a marketing role at a decent firm for a fair salary. Like I was supposed to. 

It took an over-caffeinated, finals stress-fueled moment of clarity to realize that I was more freaked out by the prospect of my future than excited by it. It wasn’t that I was dreading the new job or lifestyle – I had a great opportunity ahead of me. Instead I realized that I had passively let my future take a secure, linear path rather than actively shaping it into what I want it to be. I knew I needed to make a change, for me and only me.

I knew I wanted to learn to code, eventually. I interned at various startups and was consistently attracted to back end development, but hadn’t acquired nearly enough technical skill to apply to those jobs straight after graduation. So the question became why not learn now? 

I decided to take control of my own future and do something that excites me – programming. I know enough to know that I know very little, but I’m prepared to take on that challenge. 

And lastly – as I feel it must be noted – it is simple fact that in today’s world, men dominate the technology sector. While my original goal with coding was not explicitly to help even out the gender gap, it never hurts. Let’s get some more kickass ladies in tech. ;)
