Before starting on the Fullstack Web Development track about four weeks ago, I had merely dabbled in the world of programming. I knew the very basics of two or three languages and heard the terms “API” and “object-oriented” thrown around without having the slightest clue what they meant. As I’m now in the process of building a Tic-Tac-Toe CLI with AI, I like to think I’ve come pretty far. Yet I know this is only the tip of the iceberg in the world of computer programming. There is still so much I don’t know.

Award show season has inspired me to seek out knowledge about the greats, the superstars of programming. We’re all familiar with names like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates, but who are the legends whose names are less well known to the general public? If we were to televise an Oscars or Grammys of coding, who would be seated front row? Who would receive the lifetime achievement award, the program of the year, the best supporting role, the best sound editing?

Well okay, maybe those awards aren’t perfectly transferable. But nonetheless, I’d like to educate my fellow beginner programmers and myself on a few of the big names in programming. So without further ado, I give a non-exhaustive list of influential programmers to know:

**1.  Ada Lovelace**, AKA Ada Augusta (1815-1852): The world’s first computer programmer! 
In the mid 1800s, Lovelace wrote what is recognized as the very first algorithm for Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, an early mechanical computer.

**2.  Tim Berners Lee** (b. 1955):  Creator of HTTP and the World Wide Web
Berners Lee implemented the first successful communication between a HTTP page and server via the Internet in 1989.

**3.  Dennis Ritchie** (1941-2011): Creator of the C programming language, co-creator of the Unix operating system
The C programming language is one of the most widely used languages today and has greatly influenced the development of other languages such as Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and more. See Ken Thompson (#6) for more info on Unix.

**4.  Bjarne Stroustrup** (b. 1950): Creator of the C++ programming language
Stroustrup extended C, a procedural language, into the object-oriented style with which you can use C++. C++ is a popular choice for games, graphic user interface applications, database software, and more.

**5.  James Gosling** (b. 1955): Creator of the Java programming language
Java, based on C and C++ syntax, is now one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, especially for client-server web applications and Android devices. 

**6.  Ken Thompson** (b. 1943): Co-creator of the Unix operating system
Along with Dennis Ritchie, Thompson co-created the Unix family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems. Today’s most popular operating systems, such as Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, and more are often regarded as “Unix-like,” deriving some basic structure and functionality from the Unix system.	

**7.  Linus Torvalds** (b. 1969): Creator of the Linux kernel and Git
Linux is an open source operating system widely used for servers, mainframe computers, and supercomputers.

**8.  Donald Knuth** (b. 1938): “Father of Analysis of Algorithms”
Knuth authored The Art of Computer Programming, a highly regarded, four-volume look into many kinds of algorithms and their analysis. A Bill Gates recommended read, but not intended for beginners.

**9.  Guido van Rossum** (b. 1956): Creator of the Python programming language
Python is a popular general purpose programming language known for its readability and extensive open source libraries.

Keeping in mind that there are entire novels written about most of these people, I decided to share only their most influential contributions to computer programming in this blog.  In my own research I often found myself going down the rabbit holes into the details of their lasting impacts on the industry. I strongly recommend looking further into each and every person and language listed, as there is so much depth I was unable to cover here. But hey, now we can say we know nine highly regarded programmers and key differences in the languages they created. We’re learning one step at a time. Go forth and prosper and happy programming!
