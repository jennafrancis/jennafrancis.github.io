Some days go by so slowly that you’re sure it’s time for your lunch break, but the clock stares blankly at you with a clear, undeniable 10:01 AM.  Then there are the weeks that feel like days or hours, like your life somehow ended up on the rails of a high-speed train. Lately I have found the latter. 

Appropriately, as I approached the end of the Rails section and the start of my portfolio project a few weeks ago, things went into high gear. I graduated from college at New York University and moved into New York City. Some days I was only able to make two commits to my project – most I made none – and yet here I finally am with a complete Rails application. Continually moving forward through the chaos.

Exercise is something that always takes priority in my life, even in these crazy moments. One of my favorite ways to get motivated and fit this into my day is through group fitness classes. My application is designed to act similarly to a Yelp, if you will, of fitness classes. Anyone can browse the studios, classes, and reviews for their designated city, but you must log in with an email and password – or through Facebook – to leave a review of your own. Each class has a brief set of analytics for how many reviews they have and an average rating of customer satisfaction. Signed in users are also able to add studios, classes, and leave reviews. They are only allowed to delete, however, reviews that they have created.

Throughout the process I learned about myself as a programmer. In the past I’ve found myself pushing hard to get my code perfect the first time around. This time was different. Since some days I was only able to put in 10 minutes of work, it was more important that I got the code working than made it perfect. I created too much code, I put it in the wrong places, and hey – it still worked! Each feature came into place, and after a few long sessions of refactoring, I have a clean, DRY app (well… mostly). I got more satisfaction out of working in tiny pieces that could always be altered or thrown away than from my usual process of creating more carefully placed and curated code from the get-go. 

My biggest takeaway – refactoring is fun! I actually enjoyed taking my working app and carefully deconstructing and optimizing each piece before putting it back together. I welcomed each error messaged because I knew that my code could work – and it would work – I simply needed to find the best way to fit the puzzle pieces in place. 

So in the words of Larry the Cable Guy, “Get ‘er done.” And in my own words, “refactor later.”
